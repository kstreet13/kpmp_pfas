Jesse, Lu, Jonathan
Jonathan Nelson - medicine nephrology, kidney disease, snRNAseq
Is Visium useless? it's not really "single cell"
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) ~ youth onset T2D
PFAS may be related
Proximal tubule cells may be involved in PFAS accumulation in kidney
Human cohort w/ kidney biopsies, 70 scRNAseq, spatial proteomics(?)
Not our data, have to check with UMich about hypotheses
Jonathan making mouse model for sc/spatial(?)
Jonathan prefers single nucleus to single cell
Anything PFAS-related is "completely open"
Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) - lots of different data types, annotated
Jonathan will put together Venn diagram of different data types, go over KPMP paper

Jesse, Lu, Jonathan, Dave
Jonathan presenting on KPMP paper (Lake et al)
kidneys are routinely biopsied -> cores
diseases: AKI (acute kidney injury), CKD (chronic kidney disease)
human kidney cell atlas
lots of different omic assays (scRNA, snRNA, snATAC, spatial)
states "healthy", "adaptive", "damaged"
"adaptive score" to assess how non-standard each cell is
Jesse talking about PFAS
certain PFAS have long half-lives (3-7 years), differences may be due to kidney
single cell from 21 kidney biopsies (Renal-HEIR, kids with T2D, but not CKD), mapped to KPMP data
found "significant" association between ABCG2 expression and PFNA (type of PFAS) in a couple cell types (MC and aPT)
want to replicate this study in KPMP data

----------
Jesse, Lu, Jonathan
Jesse and Jonathan are planning experiments w/ spatial genomics, 10x
compare kidneys from mice (control diet vs. PFAS)
phenotype data about kidney function, weight
Xenium spatial data (5K panel + 100 selected genes)
neighborhood analysis for differential spatial structure?
integrate spatial (imaging) + single nuc. + outcomes (kidney injury measures)
high vs. low PFAS within disease groups
AKI might have less confounding
Jonathan ran bioinformatics club at previous university
starting up at USC, invited 10x reps
they also "have" spatial metabolomics data
resolution is not equivalent from sample to sample
Next time: I talk about spatial work with David Braun and domain/repulsion analysis (neighborhoods, attrn/repulsn, Kontextual?)

----------
Jesse, Lu
STimage-1K4M - large collection of public ST data
"multi-modal" use H&E staining image


2025-01-16
----------
new KPMP release 1.5
2.0 will include new cell annotations, new data, enrolling 1000 people
most samples with multiple assays were sick, healthy controls have fewer assays available
pseudobulk by cell type, patient
cell types: high-level or low-level IDs? high-level = more reliable, low-level -> more specific results
subclass L1 - higher level
albumineria is a confounder, bi-directional w/PFAS
might limit sample based on albumin levels
discretize PFAS into quartiles? or use EPA-set cutoffs?
there are new algorithms for spatial region detection for multi-slice
Jonathan: big paper came out with 4 major kidney microenvironments
spRNA-seq = spatial
two projects: (1) single cell data pseudobulk, PFAS effects
(2) spatial patterns, effects of PFAS
Jesse: fit separate models based on albumin level, then use meta-analysis to asses PFAS effects


2025-01-16
----------
KPMP single cell pseudobulk data at multiple levels, some clinical information
want DE genes based on continuum of PFAS levels
137 people with PFAS data
should be able to subset down to just those with PFAS
137 spot urine samples, 110 timed urine samples (12+hrs)
 - acute = AIN, ATI
 - healthy
 - chronic = DKD, HTN
 - undetermined/other
albumin / albumineria is important control (related to total amount)
ACR (albumin to creatinine level) has R^2 of .5
acute conditions don't have sustained albumineria, chronic conditions do, which can lead to peeing out PFAS
PFAS -> gene expression needs to be adjusted for ACR
hyp: exposure to PFAS causes toxicity in proximal tubule. Want to find genetic signature for that
look for metabolic disruption in list of DE genes
include 4-level disease factor
Jesse will uploaded updated clinical data


2025-02-27
----------
Jesse idea: treat pseudobulk as multi-omic data - each cell type a different "omic" layer
JIVE / MOFA for dimensionality reduction
different model: keep single-cell data, random intercept for patient, model by cell type
